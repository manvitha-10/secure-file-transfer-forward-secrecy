This is a test file for the Secure File Transfer System!

This file will be encrypted using Diffie-Hellman key exchange and forward secrecy.

Key Features Demonstrated:
1. DH Key Exchange - New keys for each session
2. Chunk-based Encryption - File split into 4KB chunks
3. XOR Cipher - With rotating key derived from shared secret
4. Checksum Verification - SHA-256 ensures integrity
5. Forward Secrecy - Each transfer uses completely new keys

If you can read this on the receiver side after decryption,
the secure file transfer was successful!

Test Data:
- Random numbers: 42, 1337, 8675309
- Special chars: !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:',.<>?
- Unicode: 🔒 🔐 🔑 ✅ ❌ 📤 📥
